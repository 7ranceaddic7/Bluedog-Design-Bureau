	description = Sturdy hexagonal probe core with integrated trusses, for attaching things such as solar panels and instruments. It includes storage for monopropellant fuel, for use with attitude control thrusters or small engines. Unfortunately this didn't leave space for any batteries - don't forget to attach them!
