	description  = A shameless coffee can full of throttleable boom. This rocket motor is meant to give you just enough kick to get you down from orbit... hopefully... It features BDB's proprietary SafeSolidâ„¢ system, allowing the engine to be shut down in flight, allowing for more accurate orbital insertions and manuevers. //'
